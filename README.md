# $${\color{orange}Goose\ Camera\ Attach}$$

Take full control of the camera in Untitled Goose Game! Goose Cam Attach lets you attach a free camera to any object in the scene, rotate around it, and switch between first-person and third-person views. Perfect for screenshots, machinima, or just exploring the world from a new perspective. (MelonLoader is required for this mod!)
